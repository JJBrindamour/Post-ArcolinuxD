Decent Sampler (x86_64)
=======================

Thanks for downloading the Linux build of Decent Sampler. The latest version can always be found here: https://www.decentsamples.com/product/decent-sampler-plugin/

This build was compiled on an older Ubuntu 16.04 machine for maximum compatibility. Here is a description of the files in this archive:

- DecentSampler: This is a **Standalone app** version of the plugin. You should be able to run this from the command-line.
- DecentSampler.so: This is the **VST2 version** of the plugin. You should put this wherever your legacy VST plugins go.
- DecentSampler.vst3: This is the **VST3 version** of the plugin. You should put this wherever your VST3 plugins go.

DecentSampler for Linux stores its config files in ~/.config/DecentSampler. 

If you run into bugs, please report them here: http://decentsamples.com/contact/

Enjoy!
