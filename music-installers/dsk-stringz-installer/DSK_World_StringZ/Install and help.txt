Thanks for download DSK VST Instrument :)

Install:
Just unzip and copy the DSK Instrument folder to your DAW or System VST folder
( if you dont know what it is, please read your DAW documentation or search in Google something like "install vst in YourDAW" )

Note:
Most of DSK Music VST dont works fine in 64 bits or Mac system.
If they dont works for you, you can use any 32 to 64 bits VST adapters, like jbridge:

Also, you can get HQ Instruments too, include all sounds from my free synths and much more (1640 instruments):

Works on ANY system.
